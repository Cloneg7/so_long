so_long: A 2D game escape adventure (C project)
This repository contains the code for a 2D game called so_long, created in C using the MiniLibX library. The goal of the game is to collect all collectibles on a map and reach the exit, while avoiding walls and (optionally) enemies.

This project is designed to help improve skills in window management, event handling, colors, textures, and more.

Features:

Basic 2D game with player movement and collectible gathering
Map parsing from a custom .ber format
Optional enemy interaction (bonus)
Optional sprite animation (bonus)
Clean code structure and adherence to coding standards
Getting Started:

Clone this repository.
Ensure you have the MiniLibX library installed.
Compile the project using the included Makefile.
Run the program with a valid map file as an argument (e.g., ./so_long my_map.ber).
